            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <sup>1</sup> was given a not so complicated name Jeleazar. <sup>2</sup> I was born on July 29, 2002, in the charming town of Cabanatuan. <sup>3</sup> My parents worked so hard to support our family. <sup>4</sup> I have 3 siblings, two older sisters and a younger brother. <sup>5</sup> We were raised in a loving and supportive home. <sup>6</sup> I grew up in a very religious household where we attended church every Sunday morning <sup>7</sup> My parents raised us with high morals and values from an early age. <sup>8</sup> I had a strong interest in basketball and played on the squad with my friends. <sup>9</sup> I also enjoyed traveling to see my distant grandparents, who lived in Bulacan. <sup>10</sup> The people who have supported me the most and have always told me to follow my aspirations are my grandparents.<sup>11</sup> Video games have been a part of my life since I was a young child. <sup>12</sup> My parents bought our first console, the play station 2, it is a gift for my birthday. <sup>13</sup> We would spend hours playing games like “Space Invaders” and “Asteroids”. <sup>14</sup> As I got older, my tastes in video games changed to more mature titles such as “Grand Theft Auto” and “Red Dead Redemption”. <sup>15</sup> Video games have always been an escape for me from reality and they still are today.<sup>16</sup> My early years were full of joy, love, and special occasions. <sup>17</sup> I had the good fortune to grow up in a loving family and close-knit community. <sup>18</sup> I attended elementary school in Cabanatuan and did well academically. <sup>19</sup> Overall, I had a really happy childhood, and I'm grateful for the events that helped me become the person I am now. <sup>20</sup> I it is no wonder that I miss those days.

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <sup>1</sup> I should start by saying that as I get older and grow older, my body is changing.<sup>2</sup>  It is mostly for us that the change of preference and consciousness on our looks started in our teenage.<sup>3</sup>  As a teenager, I continued to focus on my education and not quite excelled but I did well in my studies.<sup>4</sup>  My high school classmates are always competing with one another, so I have started to develop a motto of my own.<sup>5</sup>  One shouldn't put too much pressure on themselves to perform well in their exams because, in the end, grades don't matter;<sup>6</sup>  what matters is the level of information one has.<sup>7</sup>  Therefore, put more emphasis on learning than on grades.<sup>2</sup>  Still, learnings and discipline reflect grades.<sup>8</sup>  I discovered a passion for programming and spent countless hours learning new skills and building projects.<sup>9</sup> My parents supported my interests and encouraged me to pursue my passions.<sup>10</sup>  I started to develop a sense of independence and responsibility, taking on part-time jobs to save money for college.<sup>11</sup> I had my first serious relationship during this time, learning about love and heartbreak.<sup>12</sup>  I struggled with self-doubt and insecurity at times but had a strong support system of family and friends to help me through.<sup>13</sup>  I started to consider my future plans and career goals, researching universities and exploring potential majors. Of course, I lived my teenage life with fulfillment. <sup>14</sup> While enjoying myself I did not forget how to act in accord with what my parents taught me.<sup>15</sup>  I had a close group of friends who I spent most of my time with, and we would often have sleepovers and play video games together.<sup>16</sup>  My family was very close and we would have big gatherings with extended family on holidays and special occasions. <sup>17</sup> There are things that I missed in my teenage time. <sup>18</sup> In my teenage years, I had boundaries that I didn't cross.<sup>19</sup> I still assume that there are missed opportunities to live and act like one.<sup>20</sup>  Careless but not immoral, I supposed as of now I can't act rashly like before.<sup>21</sup>  Overall, my childhood was filled with love, laughter, and adventure, and I am grateful for the experiences and memories I made.

        <hr style="width:16px; border: 2px solid #474E68;">

            &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <sup>1</sup> The college experience often involves balancing academics, social life, and personal responsibilities. <sup>2</sup> My college years were some of the most formative and exciting times of my life.<sup>3</sup> I attended AMA Cabanatuan Campus, where I pursued a degree in Computer Science.<sup>4</sup>  During my time at the university, I was able to develop discipline in studying on my own, making new discoveries, and forming new skills over time.<sup>5</sup> The pandemic pushes us in ways that we are not familiar with. <sup>6</sup> Over the last few years, people are adapting to new terms and societal approaches. <sup>7</sup> The education system proposed a method of distance learning so students can be able to continue studying in the middle of the pandemic. <sup>8</sup> The first year of college wasn't so welcoming at all. The fact that I cannot meet or even recognize the names and faces of my classmates is indeed a source of sheer misery. <sup>9</sup> Speaking candidly, there are moments when I feel as though I cannot become a professional after pursuing the use of such a novel educational system because it doesn't genuinely feel like I'm in college. <sup>10</sup> Poor execution of the school system provided me with a responsibility to discipline myself. <sup>11</sup> With that in mind, I made the decision to step up my game and enroll in a more prestigious university in the hopes that they could help me train and develop my skills to become a professional. <sup>12</sup> I transferred to a university called The University of the East. It was a fresh start, knowing and experiencing a good sudden change of environment. <sup>13</sup> With knowledge of and exposure to a positive abrupt environmental change, it was a new beginning. <sup>14</sup> As of now, we are having a combination of a face to face and online learning. <sup>15</sup> I'm trying to be the version of myself by gradually practicing good habits that surely help me to enhance my skills and knowledge. <sup>16</sup> At the moment, I am learning the ways of living by myself. <sup>17</sup> I'm currently learning how to live independently. <sup>18</sup> College is fun, with classmates and friends until you experience having a tres, gosh it gives me mental stress then your going to be depressed. <sup>19</sup> I'm currently modifying and honing strategies to deal with school difficulties. <sup>20</sup> I am hoping or rather I say planning to walk on a bright path ahead.
